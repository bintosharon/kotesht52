In this hands on you are going to start your kubernetes journey by getting your hands dirty with few basics

Environment Setup

Check whether docker & minikube are properly installed and configured.

Start Minikube and execute this command to sync host docker with minikube docker minikube -p minikube docker-env and eval $(minikube docker-env)
Step - 1

Create a pod object using kubectl run command with google's sample image: gcr.io/google-samples/kubernetes-bootcamp:v1 and expose it on port 8080, name the pod as firstapp.

Check if the pod creation is successful by running the command: kubectl get pod firstapp

Step - 2

Expose the application to the local VM by creating a Service object of type NodePort.

Check if the service is created by running the command: kubectl get svc firstapp

Step - 3

Create another deployment using a 'YAML' file, create a deployment.yaml file that contains information of the number of replicas and the images to be used. Use an nginx image to deploy. Name the deployment as 'nginx'

Check if the deployment is created by running the command: kubectl get deployment nginx

Step - 4

Create a NodePort type service using a 'YAML' file, create a service.yaml file that contains information of the type of service and the port numbers. Name the Service nginx-svc and use port 30080 for nodePort.

Check if the service is created by running the command: kubectl get svc nginx-svc

Step - 5

Use kubectl exec command to get inside the running nginx pod and write the string 'Welcome to fresco nginx pod' to /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html file
